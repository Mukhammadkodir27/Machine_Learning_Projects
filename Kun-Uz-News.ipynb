    "## üéØ Objective\r\n",
    "The aim of this project is to scrape and analyze news articles from [kun.uz](https://kun.uz), a leading news platform in Uzbekistan. Using web scraping techniques, we will collect data from different news categories, prepare it for further analysis, and document the entire process.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## üßæ Why kun.uz?\r\n",
    "- It offers a wide range of news categories such as **Technology**, **Sports**, **Society**, etc.\r\n",
    "- The content is updated regularly, ensuring a large dataset.\r\n",
    "- News data provides strong opportunities for **natural language processing (NLP)** and **topic-based analysis**.\r\n",
    "- The site's `robots.txt` does not block scraping of news categories, making it legal and ethical for academic purposes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## üõ† Tools & Technologies\r\n",
    "- **BeautifulSoup** ‚Äì for parsing and extracting HTML content.\r\n",
    "- **Selenium** ‚Äì for interacting with dynamic content.\r\n",
    "- **Pandas** ‚Äì for structuring and cleaning the data.\r\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì for organizing, documenting, and running the project code.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## üóÇ Project Workflow\r\n",
    "1. **Select Target Categories** from kun.uz (e.g., Technology, Sports).\r\n",
    "2. **Scrape Articles** using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.\r\n",
    "3. **Extract Key Data Fields**: title, publication date, article content, category, and URL.\r\n",
    "4. **Clean and Prepare** the data for analysis.\r\n",
    "5. **Document and Report** the process and findings.\r\n",
    "\r\n",

       "'Speaking before leaders from Central Asia and the European Union, President Japarov reaffirmed Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs commitment to strengthening mutually beneficial ties with its closest neighbors and external partners. ‚ÄúDeepening cooperation with neighboring countries remains a top priority of Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs foreign policy,‚Äù he stated, highlighting that close collaboration among Central Asian states plays a pivotal role in maintaining security and sustainable development in the region.\\nJaparov underlined recent breakthroughs in regional diplomacy, including the formal resolution of long-standing border disputes. ‚ÄúIn 2022, we signed a historic agreement with Uzbekistan to formalize our state border. Now, the Kyrgyz-Tajik border has also been completely resolved,‚Äù he noted. He recalled the recent visit of Tajik President Emomali Rahmon to Bishkek, during which the treaty on the state border was signed and subsequently ratified by Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs parliament on March 25.\\n‚ÄúThese landmark agreements were warmly welcomed by the peoples of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and by the international community as a symbol of growing mutual trust and peaceful coexistence,‚Äù he added.\\nAs a continuation of this regional momentum, President Japarov mentioned the trilateral summit held on March 31 with the presidents of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, where the three leaders signed an agreement on the exact point of intersection of their state borders.\\nTurning to cooperation with the European Union, President Japarov praised the upward trajectory of trade relations. ‚ÄúOver the past four years, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs trade turnover with the EU has increased by 2.4 times, driven by rising imports and exports,‚Äù he said. He credited this success to market openness and the EU‚Äôs Generalized System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) initiative, which grants Kyrgyz products preferential access to 27 EU markets.\\nJaparov also invited European businesses to explore investment opportunities in Kyrgyzstan, highlighting the country‚Äôs strategic location and growing role as a regional transit hub.\\nA major focus of his speech was Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs energy potential. The President urged European partners to participate in large-scale hydropower and renewable energy projects, particularly the flagship Kambar-Ata-1 Hydropower Plant. ‚ÄúWe have already launched the construction of this major 1,860 MW facility, in partnership with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,‚Äù he said.\\nIn 2023 alone, Kyrgyzstan commissioned 18 small hydropower plants and plans to build 15 more this year. Additionally, solar energy projects totaling more than 400 MW in capacity are underway. ‚ÄúGiven the realities of global climate change, transitioning to a green economy and renewable energy is our only path toward sustainable development,‚Äù he stressed.\\nPresident Japarov welcomed the EU‚Äôs ‚Ç¨10 billion commitment to sustainable transport connectivity in Central Asia. He also proposed deeper cooperation in the field of critical raw materials, noting Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs substantial reserves of rare and precious metals.\\n‚ÄúTo strengthen this cooperation, we propose establishing a dedicated partnership or roadmap similar to the agreements already made between the EU and other regional countries,‚Äù he suggested.\\nIn closing, President Japarov expressed Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs readiness to deepen its cooperation with the European Union across all strategic areas. He voiced confidence that the summit would result in tangible agreements that would advance Central Asia‚ÄìEU relations.'"

       "07:04 / 24.03.2025  Business  Foreign vehicle sales in Uzbekistan drop over 50% in a month                                                       The Center for Economic Research and Reforms haspresentedan analysis of Uzbekistan‚Äôs automotive market for February.\\nAccording to the analysis, activity in both primary and secondary automotive markets showed an average decline last month.\\nWhile sales of new locally manufactured light vehicles remained stable, sales of foreign-manufactured vehicles dropped by more than half.\\nIn the electric vehicle segment, despite a decrease in activity by the end of the month, growth is observed when compared to the previous year.\\nPrimarymarket\\nThe light vehicle market is experiencing an overall decline in sales, primarily driven by reduced activity in the foreign vehicle segment.\\nIn February, light vehicle sales fell by 14.5% compared to the previous month, totaling 67,200 units.\\nDuring the month, sales of new locally produced vehicles remained nearly unchanged at 21,700 units, while sales in the new foreign vehicle segment decreased by more than half.\\nSecondarymarket\\nActivity in the secondary market for light vehicles also declined.\\nIn February, 43,300 vehicles were bought and sold, a 16% drop compared to January of this year.\\nElectricvehiclemarket\\nThe segment for new light electric vehicles shows signs of declining activity. In February, sales amounted to 2,900 electric vehicles, down 11% from the previous month.\\nHowever, on a year-over-year basis ‚Äî compared to February 2024 ‚Äî activity has more than doubled.\\nImportsoflightvehiclesshrink\\nAccording to data from the Customs Committee, vehicle imports in January and February shrank nearly fourfold compared to the same period last year, dropping from 17,396 units to 4,369 units.\\nImports of gasoline-powered vehicles fell from 12,233 to 2,745 units (a 4.5-fold decrease), electric vehicles from 3,489 to 1,555 units (a 2.3-fold decrease), and hybrid vehicles from 1,674 to just 69 units (a 24-fold decrease).\\nThe reduction in imports and the decline in market activity are occurring against the backdrop of non-tariff restrictions.\\nSince November 1, 2024, imported vehicles have been required to undergo technical testing at a testing ground in Piskent rather than at customs facilities. The current capacity of this auto testing site, which is several times lower than actual demand, may be contributing to the sharp decline in import volumes.\\nAdditionally, electromagnetic compatibility testing for vehicles was introduced in November.\\nAs a reminder, starting May 1, 2025, the recycling fee for electric vehicles will increase significantly. For electric vehicles manufactured less than three years ago, the fee will be set at 120 times the Base Calculation Unit (BCU), equivalent to 45 million UZS ‚Äî four times higher than the current fee of 30 BCU (11.25 million UZS).\\nFor electric vehicles over three years old, the recycling fee will be 210 times the BCU, or 78.75 million UZS ‚Äî 2.3 times higher than the current fee of 90 BCU (33.75 million UZS).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://kun.uz/en/news/category/business  https://kun.uz/en/news/2025/03/24/foreign-vehicle-sales-in-uzbekistan-drop-over-50-in-a-month                                                       2025-04-05      1\n",

       "17:10 / 03.04.2025  Society   The story of a student who transformed a container into a learning center in Fergana‚Äôs Vodil                       Islomjon Muhammadjonov is studying at the Fergana branch of the Tashkent University of Information Technologies. He saved up money to buy a container, refurbished it, and opened a learning center inside it, offering free training in modern professions to young people in his village. \"I bought the container, but the real challenge started after that. I didn‚Äôt know where to place it, and everything seemed to fall into place eventually. Although it's small, we‚Äôve achieved success,\" he says.\\n\\nIslomjon Muhammadjonov is a 24-year-old youth leader from the \"Obod\" community in Vodil village, Fergana district. He established the \"Obod Ta'lim\" learning center in his neighborhood.\\n\"One of my biggest goals has been achieved. I am happy about that. I have been providing free training to local youth in modern professions inside a small container.\\n\"Initially, I saved up 18 million UZS to buy the container. But then, I didn‚Äôt know where to place it, which gave me a headache. Many places were already occupied.\\n\"In fact, someone had already taken the space next to the school with the intention of building a shop.\\n\"In the end, after some problems, we managed to place the container near the school. My father and uncle are craftsmen, and they repaired the container to a level where it could be used as a learning center. Otherwise, it would have cost a significant amount to repair. I opened the center and equipped it with computer setups. The most important thing is that we started offering free education to the local youth.\\n\"Currently, the youth are receiving training in mobile photography, graphic design, web design, computer literacy, and English. The good news is that the young people studying at our center have started earning personal income. They are finding their own path in life.\\n\"To be honest, I lived with the container idea for a year and a half. I contacted every organization and asked for a place. We even feared that if we got the space, they might not allow a learning center but rather open a shop. The idea of turning a container into a learning center was something no one had ever considered before.\\n\"The container is only 2.5 meters wide and 13 meters long.
