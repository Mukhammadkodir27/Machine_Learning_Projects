    "# üì∞ Web Scraping Project: News Articles from kun.uz\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Objective\n",
    "The aim of this project is to scrape and analyze news articles from [kun.uz](https://kun.uz), a leading news platform in Uzbekistan. Using web scraping techniques, we will collect data from different news categories, prepare it for further analysis, and document the entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßæ Why kun.uz?\n",
    "- It offers a wide range of news categories such as **Technology**, **Sports**, **Society**, etc.\n",
    "- The content is updated regularly, ensuring a large dataset.\n",
    "- News data provides strong opportunities for **natural language processing (NLP)** and **topic-based analysis**.\n",
    "- The site's `robots.txt` does not block scraping of news categories, making it legal and ethical for academic purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üí° All tools are used within a **Jupyter Notebook** environment for interactive development and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üóÇ Project Workflow\n",
    "1. **Define Target Categories**  \n",
    "   - A list of 7 category URLs (e.g., politics, tech, tourism) is prepared for scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Selenium WebDriver**  \n",
    "   - Chrome browser is automated using Selenium.\n",
    "   - Cookie consent banners are detected and accepted programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Dynamic Content**  \n",
    "   - The \"Load More News\" button is clicked multiple times using Selenium to reveal additional articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Store Raw Page Source**  \n",
    "   - For each category, the final loaded HTML is stored for parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup**  \n",
    "   - Extract article links, headlines, publication dates, and summary previews from each category page.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fetch Full Articles with Requests**  \n",
    "   - Each article is visited individually using the Requests library to extract full content paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Clean and Format Data**  \n",
    "   - Dates are extracted using **regex** and standardized using `datetime`.\n",
    "   - All relevant information is stored in a structured format (list of dictionaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Export to CSV**  \n",
    "   - The final dataset is converted into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as `Kun-Uz.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ö†Ô∏è _Note: This project is for educational purposes only. All data is used in compliance with kun.uz‚Äôs robots.txt file and scraping best practices._\n"

    "## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries and Tools Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin the web scraping process, let's ensure that all necessary libraries are installed and properly set up. This project utilizes the following Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BeautifulSoup (`bs4`)**: For parsing and extracting data from HTML content.\n",
    "- **Selenium**: For automating web browser interactions, particularly useful for handling dynamic content like ‚ÄúLoad More‚Äù buttons or cookie banners.\n",
    "- **Pandas (`pd`)**: For organizing and analyzing the scraped data, and exporting to CSV.\n",
    "- **Requests**: For sending HTTP requests to fetch individual article content.\n",
    "- **NumPy (`np`)**: Used for generating randomized delays to mimic human behavior.\n",
    "- **Regular Expressions (`re`)**: Used for cleaning and formatting dates from raw text.\n",
    "- **Datetime**: Used for converting raw date strings into a consistent date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).\n",
    "- **TQDM**: Provides progress bars to visually track scraping progress.\n",
    "- **Webdriver Manager**: Automatically handles downloading and managing the correct ChromeDriver version for Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to install these packages if you haven‚Äôt already:"

The technology ensures that unauthorized access and biometric profile forgery are impossible, providing passengers with a reliable and secure payment method.\\nHow it works\\nTo use the system, passengers must:\\n- Create a biometric profile.\\n- Scan their palms at an information kiosk located at designated metro stations.\\n- Link their profile to an \"ATTO\" transport card or a compatible smartphone app.\\n- Once set up, passengers can seamlessly pass through the turnstiles with a simple palm scan.\\nPilot testing and expansion\\nThe palm payment system was initially piloted in late November 2023 at the \"Xalqlar Do'stligi\" metro station. After its successful trial, the service was rolled out in early 2024 to 12 additional stations on the Chilonzor line.
