    "# Blogging App with Streamlit\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Introduction\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In today's digital world, blogging has become an essential way to share knowledge, ideas, and experiences. Whether for personal use or business purposes, a blog provides an accessible platform to connect with a wider audience. Building a simple yet efficient blogging app can be a great way to learn about web development, database management, and user interaction.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "I chose **Streamlit** for building this blogging app because of its ease of use and rapid development capabilities. Streamlit allows for quick and efficient deployment of Python-based applications with minimal setup. It enables developers to focus more on building the app's core functionality rather than worrying about the complexities of traditional web frameworks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Why Streamlit?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Fast Development:** Streamlit allows for building interactive apps with just a few lines of Python code. This made it an ideal choice for this project, where I wanted to focus on creating a feature-rich yet simple blogging platform.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- **Built-in Interactivity:** Streamlit provides built-in widgets for user interaction, such as forms, buttons, and sliders, that make it easy to create a dynamic app without needing to write complex JavaScript or HTML.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- **Integration with Data Science Libraries:** Streamlit is well-suited for projects that involve data analysis, machine learning, and visualization, as it integrates seamlessly with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. This flexibility was beneficial when adding features like word clouds or displaying analytics.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Easy Deployment:** With minimal configuration, Streamlit apps can be deployed easily on cloud platforms such as Streamlit Cloud or Heroku. This makes sharing your app with others quick and straightforward.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Features of the Blogging App\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This app enables users to:\r\n",
    "- Register and log in securely.\r\n",
    "- Create, view, and manage blog posts.\r\n",
    "- Interact with blogs by adding comments, likes, and tags.\r\n",
    "- Track likes and comments, allowing for community engagement.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "By utilizing **SQLite** as the database backend, I have created a seamless connection between the frontend and the data storage layer, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's dive into the features and functionalities of the app!\r\n"

    "# Approach to Run Streamlit from Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit apps are traditionally run via a Python script with the `.py` extension. However, Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) are not directly compatible with Streamlit's execution. To overcome this issue, I developed a custom approach that allows me to run the Streamlit app directly from a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "### Convert Jupyter Notebook to Python Script\n",
    "Since Jupyter doesn't natively support running Streamlit apps, I used **Jupytext**, a tool that allows converting `.ipynb` files into `.py` files. This conversion allows us to run the Streamlit app from the notebook by executing the Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert the notebook into a Python script, I use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupytext --to py your_notebook.ipynb"

    "# Teamwork and Collaboration\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This project was a collaborative effort between **Mukhammadkodir Abdusalomov** and **Elbek Majidov**. While it may seem simple on the surface, we put in a lot of hard work and thought into the development of this blogging app. We carefully planned the ideologies, how each function should operate, the database schema, and much more. Our goal was to create a seamless and efficient blogging platform, and every aspect of the app was shaped by our combined efforts.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Roles and Responsibilities\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Mukhammadkodir Abdusalomov** was primarily responsible for the **Python part** of the app. He worked on developing the core functionality, including the app’s logic, authentication system, blog management, and integration with the SQLite database.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- **Elbek Majidov** focused on the **user management** aspect of the app and was responsible for **SQL-related tasks**. This included designing the database schema, creating the necessary tables, and managing the relationships between users, blogs, comments, likes, and tags.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Effective Collaboration\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We made sure to communicate effectively and regularly throughout the project, discussing every detail to ensure the app functions as intended. Our collaborative approach included:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Git and GitHub**: We used Git and GitHub for version control and to ensure smooth collaboration. This allowed us to work on different parts of the project simultaneously while keeping track of changes, merging work, and resolving any conflicts efficiently.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Streamlit Documentation**: To better understand Streamlit’s capabilities, we referred to the official Streamlit documentation. This helped us learn about its powerful features, widgets, and customization options, enabling us to make the most of the framework for our app.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Constant Feedback**: We frequently reviewed each other’s work, provided feedback, and adjusted the design and functionality to improve the app.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Conclusion\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Building this app was a great learning experience for both of us, and it wouldn’t have been possible without our teamwork and dedication. The combination of Mukhammadkodir's Python expertise and Elbek’s database management skills allowed us to create a functional and interactive blogging platform. Working together, we were able to overcome challenges and bring this project to life.\r\n"
